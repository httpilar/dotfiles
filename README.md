# Dotfiles
Initial -very basic- personal configurations regarding Zsh, Vim and Git.

## Content

- bin: executable scripts (empty for now).
- docs: documentation, notes (wip, i love documenting everything).
- editors: config for other editors (long live vscode).
- git: git configs (`.gitconfig` for now)
- scripts: installations, bootstraps and more (another wip).
- vim: really basic vim configuration (just toying around for the future - `.vimrc`)
- zsh: extended zsh configuration (main, contains `.aliases`, `.functions` and `.zshrc`).

## Disclaimers

Since these are my first ever steps with GitHub, I don't think it's worth installing it, yet. I'll keep toying around until I come up with format and configs I feel comfortable with, and only then, I'll add an installation guide to it. I'll keep adding new things when I get the hang of it, and always update the Readme.

For anyone reading this far, I'm aware of how simple and basic this is, but I'm here to learn. I'm always on the lookout for feedback :).

## Special thanks
Regarding the zsh part - Credits to [olets](https://olets.dev/posts/my-zshrc-zsh-configuration-annotated/), who has an incredibly well explained post on the matter (well documented and fact-checked).
